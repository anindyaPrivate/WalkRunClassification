# WalkRunClassification
Create a predictive model to classify whether a person is running or walking based on the given predictor variables.



Multi-layer neural networks will be trained and evaluated based on data from Run or
Walk Reduced dataset. Note that this Run or Walk Final dataset uses only the subset of
data from the original Run or Walk dataset.
